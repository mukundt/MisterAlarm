MisterAlarm: HackPrinceton 2014 Project

Mister Alarm is an alarm clock that will wake you up in a number of innovative, obnoxious, and motivating ways;  this ranges from light music, and flickering your lamp, to spraying you with mist.   If you attempt to snooze,  with the wave of your hand over an ultrasonic sensor, Mister Alarm will advertise your laziness to all of your Twitter followers.  Upon the second snooze, it will read out today's events from your Google Calendar.  Upon the last snooze, it will blow a car horn.

We created our Mister Alarm iPhone app with the Twitter API and Open Ears/Google Calendar API for text-to-speech integration. The app connects to an Arduino via a wireless Bluetooth pipeline, which enables it to interact with a variety of hardware, including a servo motor attached to a spray bottle, a desk lamp attached to a wall outlet, a sonar sensor, and a car horn.
