394755170732482560	[F 10] [R 8]	@lfopw	This new design fad of blurring distinction between UI chrome and content is fundamentally wrongheaded IMO. Usability suffers.

394845369269358592	[F 1] [R 0]	@rosyna	Hmm, TransformProcessType() appears to be the only thing in the Process Manager not deprecated in Mac OS X 10.9. Why no AppKit version?
394590912221040640	[F 1] [R 0]	@boredzo	Biggest AirDrop confuser: It apparently requires:
                                    - Wi-Fi on
                                    - Bluetooth on
                                    - iCloud signed in
                                    But doesn‚Äôt require being on a Wi-Fi network.
394622132657090560	[F 6] [R 3]	@drdrang	The data may be crap, but I like a maps app that scrolls when you do a two-finger swipe. No more accidental zooms.
394832623303798784	[F 1] [R 0]	@invalidname	I've never used Pages for Mac much anyways, but no way would I use it without keyboard shortcuts for user-defined paragraph styles.
394880788761554945	[F 1] [R 0]	@dlpasco	How many people out there really, truly feel like they can sleep better knowing they can run iWork apps on their phone?
